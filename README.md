# Virtual hand signals

A web app for virtual hand signals to encourage equal partipication in meetings.
Inspired by a [GDS blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/10/07/platform-as-a-service-team-takes-even-handed-approach-to-meetings/).

## Installation

The app can be built by running `bash build.sh`.
